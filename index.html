            <p>* Trade‑in values will vary based on the condition, year, and configuration of your eligible trade‑in
                device. Not all devices are eligible for credit. You must be at least the age of majority to be eligible
                to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade‑in value may be applied toward qualifying new
                device purchase, or added to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a
                qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate was made. Sales tax may be assessed on
                full value of a new device purchase. In‑store trade‑in requires presentation of a valid photo ID (local
                law may require saving this information). Offer may not be available in all stores, and may vary between
                in‑store and online trade‑in. Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its trade‑in
                partners reserve the right to refuse, cancel, or limit quantity of any trade‑in transaction for any
                reason. More details are available from Apple′s trade‑in partner for trade‑in and recycling of eligible

            <p> Pricing for iPhone 17 includes a $30 connectivity discount that requires activation with AT&T, Boost
                Mobile, T‑Mobile, or Verizon. Pricing shown for iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus includes a $30 connectivity
                discount for Boost Mobile, T‑Mobile, and Verizon customers that requires activation and would otherwise
                be $30 higher for all other customers. Financing available to qualified customers, subject to credit
                approval and credit limit, and requires you to select Citizens One Apple iPhone Payments or Apple Card
                Monthly Installments (ACMI) as your payment type at checkout at Apple. You’ll need to select AT&T, Boost
                Mobile, T‑Mobile, or Verizon as your carrier when you checkout. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is always
                unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time, subject to your carrier’s terms. Taxes and shipping on
                items purchased using ACMI are subject to your card’s variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. ACMI is not
                available for purchases made online at special storefronts. The last month’s payment for each product
                will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly payment amount. ACMI
                financing is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, installment
                term lengths and eligible products. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement for more information about
                ACMI. Additional Citizens One Apple iPhone Payments terms are here.</p>
            <p> Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select
                it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible products purchased at Apple Store locations, apple.com, the
                Apple Store app, or by calling 1‑800‑MY‑APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit. See
                support.apple.com/102730 for more information about eligible products. Existing customers: See your
                Customer Agreement for your variable APR. As of July 1, 2025, the variable APR on new Apple Card
                accounts ranges from 18.24% to 28.49%. You must elect to use ACMI at checkout. If you buy an
                ACMI‑eligible product with a one-time payment on Apple Card at checkout, that purchase is subject to
                your Apple Card’s variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. Taxes and shipping on items purchased using ACMI
                are subject to your Apple Card’s variable APR, not the ACMI 0% APR. In order to buy an iPhone with ACMI,
                you must select one of the following carriers: AT&T, Boost Mobile, T‑Mobile, or Verizon. An iPhone
                purchased with ACMI is always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time, subject to your
                carrier’s terms. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple
                Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small
                businesses; Government and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs; or on refurbished devices. The last
                month’s payment for each product will be the product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the
                monthly payment amount. ACMI is subject to change at any time for any reason, including but not limited
                to installment term lengths and eligible products. See the Apple Card Customer Agreement for more
                information about ACMI.</p>
